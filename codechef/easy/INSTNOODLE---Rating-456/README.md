## Problem

### Chef and Instant Noodles

Chef has invented $1$-minute Instant Noodles. As the name suggests, each packet takes exactly $1$ minute to cook.

Chef's restaurant has $X$ stoves and only $1$ packet can be cooked in a single stove at any minute.

How many customers can Chef serve in $Y$ minutes if each customer orders exactly $1$ packet of noodles?

### Input Format
- The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the number of stoves and the number of minutes, respectively.
### Output Format
- Print a single integer, the maximum number of customers Chef can serve in $Y$ minutes
### Constraints
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3 7
```

```
21
```

### Explanation:

Chef cooks for $Y = 7$ minutes and can cook $X = 3$ packets per minute, one on each stove.

So, the total number of packets that can be cooked is $X \cdot Y = 3 \cdot 7 = 21$.

Each person orders one packet, so the maximum number of customers that can be served is $21$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
7 8
```

```
56
```

### Explanation:

Chef cooks for $Y = 8$ minutes and can cook $X = 7$ packets per minute, one on each stove.

So, the total number of packets that can be cooked is $X \cdot Y = 7 \cdot 8 = 56$.

Each person orders one packet, so the maximum number of customers that can be served is $56$.
